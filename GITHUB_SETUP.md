# GitHub Setup Instructions

## What I Need From You

**Please provide your GitHub repository URL.** It should look like one of these:

- `https://github.com/yourusername/proofpay.git`
- `git@github.com:yourusername/proofpay.git`

You can find this on your GitHub repository page by clicking the green "Code" button.

## What I've Done

✅ Initialized Git repository  
✅ Created initial commit with all project files  
✅ Updated README.md  
✅ Verified .gitignore is properly configured  

## Next Steps (After You Provide GitHub URL)

Once you give me your GitHub repository URL, I will:

1. Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
2. Push the code to GitHub
3. Provide you with instructions to connect it to Vercel

## Current Status

Your project is ready to push to GitHub. Just need the repository URL!
