# GitHub Setup - What I Need

## Step 1: Git Configuration

I need to configure Git with your information. Please provide:

1. **Your Name** (for Git commits)
2. **Your Email** (for Git commits - can be your GitHub email)

Or you can run these commands yourself:

```powershell
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

## Step 2: GitHub Repository URL

Please provide your GitHub repository URL. You can find it by:

1. Going to your GitHub repository page
2. Clicking the green **"Code"** button
3. Copying the HTTPS URL (looks like: `https://github.com/username/repo-name.git`)

## What I'll Do Once You Provide This

1. ✅ Configure Git with your name/email (or you can do it)
2. ✅ Create the initial commit
3. ✅ Add your GitHub repository as remote
4. ✅ Push code to GitHub
5. ✅ Provide instructions to connect to Vercel

## Quick Start (If You Want to Do It Yourself)

If you prefer to set it up yourself, here are the commands:

```powershell
# 1. Configure Git (replace with your info)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# 2. Create initial commit
cd "C:\Users\user\ProofPay Cursor"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: ProofPay monorepo"

# 3. Add GitHub remote (replace with your URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# 4. Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

**Just let me know:**
- Your name and email (or if you'll configure it yourself)
- Your GitHub repository URL

And I'll complete the setup for you!
